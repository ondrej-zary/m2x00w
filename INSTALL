How to Build and Install the m2300w Driver:
===========================================

Prerequisites:
--------------

    1. Ghostscript

       Please refer to README.ghostscript or to
       http://m2300w.sourceforge.net/gs/

    2. Foomatic (see http://www.linuxprinting.org/foomatic.html)

       Foomatic is a database-driven system for integrating free
       software printer drivers (like the m2300w driver) with common
       spoolers under Unix. It supports CUPS, LPRng, LPD, GNUlpr, PPR,
       PDQ, CPS, and direct printing.

       Although m2300w-wrapper could be theoretically invoked directly,
       it is basically designed for being invoked from foomatic's universal
       print filter "foomatic-rip".
       
       Therefore, m2300w requires "foomatic-rip" as prerequisite. Some
       Linux distributions (e.g. SuSE) include foomatic-rip, while it
       is missing in other distributions (e.g. RedHat 9).

       To verify whether "foomatic-rip" is installed on your system,
       you can check, if the file /usr/bin/foomatic-rip and the
       symbolic link /usr/lib/cups/filter/foomatic-rip exist.
       
       If they do not exist, then get the latest "foomatic-filters"
       package from http://www.linuxprinting.org/download/foomatic and
       install it on your system.

       For your convenience, starting with version 0.3, the pre-built
       m2300w RPM package (see below) installs a foomatic-rip binary,
       if it is missing on the system. If you build the driver from
       the sources, then you need to build and install "foomatic-filters"
       yourself.

    3. Spooler

       Basically, m2300w is expected to work with all spoolers supported
       by foomatic. However, the preferred spooler is CUPS, and m2300w
       has only been tested in conjunction with CUPS.

    4. Psnup

       If you intend to use the n-up feature of the driver, the program
       "psnup" needs to be installed on your system.


Using the pre-built RPM:
------------------------

    We are also providing a pre-built RPM for download. This RPM was
    built on SuSE Linux 8.1, but since it does not depend on particular
    SuSE features, there is a good chance, that it may also work with
    other Linux distributions, which support RPM.

    1. Make sure that all prerequisites are installed (see above)

    2. download m2300w-<version>.rpm from
       http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=108751

    3. install or upgrade the rpm package (needs to be done as root)

	$ su
	Password: ********
    	$ rpm -U m2300w-<version>.rpm

    4. Run cups config to install a new printer

       If you are upgrading from a previous version of the m2300w
       driver, then REMOVE all printer queues which are associated
       with the m2300w driver and reinstall them from the scratch.


Building and installing the driver from the source distribution:
----------------------------------------------------------------

    1. Make sure that all prerequisites are installed (see above)

    2. Download m2300w-<version>.tar.gz from
       http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=108751

    3. Unpack the archive:

       $ tar zxvf m2300w-<version>.tar.gz
       	   or
       $ gzip -dc m2300w-<version>.tar.gz | tar xvf -
       (if you are not using GNU tar)

    4. Enter the top-level directory and run "configure"

       $ cd m2300w-<version>
       $ ./configure

    5. Run make

       $ make

    6. Install the files (needs to be done as root)

	$ su
	Password: ********
	# make install

    7. Run cups config to install a new printer

       If you are upgrading from a previous version of the m2300w
       driver, then REMOVE all printer queues which are associated
       with the m2300w driver and reinstall them from the scratch.


Building the RPM package from the source distribution:
------------------------------------------------------

    The spec file included in the distribution only supports
    packaging of the files. You CANNOT use rpm to BUILD the driver
    with the supplied spec file. In order to build a RPM package
    from the source distribution, perform the following steps:

    1. Download m2300w-<version>.tar.gz from
       http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=108751

    2. Unpack the archive:

       $ tar zxvf m2300w-<version>.tar.gz
       	   or
       $ gzip -dc m2300w-<version>.tar.gz | tar xvf -
       (if you are not using GNU tar)

    3. Enter the top-level directory and run "configure"

       $ cd m2300w-<version>
       $ ./configure

    4. Run make to build the RPM

       $ make rpm

       The resulting RPM package is placed in rpm's built-in standard
       location, usually /usr/src/packages/RPMS/i386 (or similar).
       Make sure that this directory is writeable for your user id
       if you don't run "make rpm" as "root".


Building the binary RPM package from the source RPM:
----------------------------------------------------

    1. Download source RPM package m2300w-<version>-<release>.src.rpm

    2. Install the source RPM package

       # rpm -i m2300w-<version>-<release>.src.rpm

    3. Build the binary RPM package
    
       # cd /usr/src/packages/SPECS
       # rpm -bb m2300w-<version>-<release>.spec

       The resulting RPM package is placed in rpm's built-in standard
       location, usually /usr/src/packages/RPMS/i386 (or similar).
