What is m2300w?
---------------

    The m2300w driver is an open source Linux driver for the
    Konica Minolta magicolor 2300W and 2400W color laser printers.

    The driver is basically intended for being used in conjunction with
    "foomatic" (see http://www.linuxprinting.org/foomatic.html), which
    is a database-driven system for integrating free software printer
    drivers with common spoolers under Unix, like CUPS, LPRng, LPD,
    GNUlpr, PPR, PDQ, CPS, and direct printing.

    Though we do our best to avoid that, there is a small residual
    risk, that the use of this driver may damage your printer.
    It is a fact, that laser printer engines CAN BE damaged if
    they are not driven appropriately (for instance, putting down
    far too much toner on the paper can actually contaminate or
    even damage the fuser, etc.).

    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.


What's new in 0.5?
------------------

    The m2300w driver now also supports the magicolor 2400W.

    Special thanks go to Thomas Rohringer for contributing
    the backend for the 2400W.


What's new in 0.4?
------------------

    Version 0.4 contains no new features. It only resolves
    the following bugs:

    - 1022300 Should not start CUPS automatically

      Now CUPS is only restarted, if it cupsd is running, thus
      avoiding the start of CUPS, if it was not running previously.

    - 1034790 m2300w does not work with gs 8.15

      A workaround for the ghostscript problem
      http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=687702 has been
      implemented. Now m2300w 0.4 now can be used in conjunction
      with the new ghostscript versions >= 8.15.


What's new in 0.3?
------------------

    This is the 3rd pre-release of the driver.

    * Reworked print modes

      - Added AutoColor mode, which detects pages containing only black
        text, and prints these pages in B/W, which is much faster, while
        color pages are still printed in color.

      - Added a Draft mode for saving toner

      - Recreated all color profiles

      - Added an option to specify how to interpret /DeviceRGB
        colors in the PostScript documents being printed

      - Added a "PrintoutMode" option for selecting the most
        common print modes with a single paramter

    * Improved checks for required prerequisites

    * Added workaround for several problems of gs 7.xx

    * Added full RPM build capability

    * The RPM now installs foomatic-rip, if missing on the system


Installation
------------

    Please refer to the instructions in the INSTALL file.


Driver options
--------------

    Please refer to the foomatic documentation and/or your spooler's
    documentation, how to speficy driver options in conjunction with
    a particular spooler.

    For instance with CUPS, you can preset the default options for
    a particular printer queue in the "Configure Printer" dialog
    of the CUPS web interface, or you can also override individual
    options for one particular print job at the "lp" command line, like

	lp -d myprinter -o MediaType=Carton -o ColorProfile=Photo ...


    Options supported by the m2300w driver:

    PageSize ............ Select the page size.
			  Default: A4

	A4 .............. Select A4 paper.
	A5 .............. Select A5 paper.
	Legal ........... Select Legal paper.
	Letter .......... Select Letter paper.

    MediaType ........... Select the media type (analog to the Windows
			  driver). According to the printer docs, for paper
			  up to 90g/m2, use "Standard", for paper thicker
			  than 90g/m2, use "Carton". Otherwise, use the
			  type which corresponds to your medium. Selecting
			  a wrong type may damage the fuser.
			  Default: Standard

	Carton .......... Select "Carton" media type.
	Envelope ........ Select "Envelope" media type.
	Labels .......... Select "Labels" media type.
	Letterhead ...... Select "Letterhead" media type.
	Postcard ........ Select "Postcard" media type.
	Standard ........ Select "Standard" media type.
	Transparency .... Select "Transparency" media type.

    Multipage ........... Select the printing of several logical pages on
    			  a single sheet of paper (n-up printing). The
			  program "psnup" needs to be installed on your
			  system in order that you can use this feature.
			  Default: none

	none ............ Disable n-up printing.
	2up ............. Print two pages on one sheet.
	4up ............. Print four pages on one sheet.

    PrintoutMode ........ Allows the selection of the most common
			  print modes with a single option.
			  Default: Auto

	Auto ............ Automatically detects pages containing black
			  text only, and print such pages in B/W, all
			  other pages are printed in color.
	Gray ............ Force printing in grayscale.
	Photo ........... Print in color using the "Photo" color profile.
	Draft ........... Economy mode to save toner, approx. newspaper
			  quality.
	Draft.Gray ...... Grayscale economy mode.

    Quality ............. Selects the print quality.
			  Default: @PrintoutMode

	@PrintoutMode ... Controlled by PrintoutMode
	Normal .......... Normal print quality.
	Draft ........... Economy mode to save toner. The option ColorProfile
			  is ignored with Quality=Draft - there exists only
			  a single color profile for draft mode.

    ColorMode ........... Selects B/W or color printing
			  Default: @PrintoutMode

	@PrintoutMode ... Controlled by PrintoutMode
	Gray ............ Force printing in grayscale
	Color ........... Print in color

    ColorProfile ........ Select the color profile (CRD) to use.
			  The included color profiles have been made for
			  "Premium Choice Laser Paper" CHP410, using
			  the "MediaType=Carton" option, and therefore
			  will give the best color reproduction on this
			  paper brand. However, the profiles work reasonalby
			  well for other paper types too (e.g. normal copier
			  paper).
			  The option ColorProfile is ignored in conjunction
			  with "Quality=Draft", there exists only a single
			  color profile for draft mode.
			  Default: @PrintoutMode

	@PrintoutMode ... Controlled by PrintoutMode
	AutoColor ....... Automatically detects pages containing black
			  text only, and print such pages in B/W, all
			  other pages are printed in color. This slightly
			  impacts the darkness of black and dark colors,
			  since black is printed with black toner only.
	Photo ........... Optimized for printing photos, produces deep,
			  dark colors. The black generation uses as much
			  black toner as possible.
	Photo-kh ........ Another profile optimized for printing photos.
			  The black generation uses less black toner than
			  'Photo'. The 'Photo' mode will give more neutral
			  grayscales, but for some images, 'Photo-kh' may
			  look more pleasing. Judge yourself and choose the
			  photo mode you like better.
	None ............ Turn off CIE-based color matching. This setting
			  is useful, if you want to print test charts for
			  making your own color profiles using 3rd party
			  software. It is rather not useful otherwise.
	User[1-5] ....... User defined CRD #1-5. This settings requires
			  that you supply your self-made CRD files as
			  /usr/share/m2300w/<version>/psfiles/User[1-5].crd

    DefRGB .............. This option defines, how /DeviceRGB colors
			  in printed PostScript documents are interpreted,
			  i.e. which RGB color space is assumed for these
			  RGB colors.
			  (Actually I wanted to call this option "DefaultRGB"
			  to comply with the PostScript terminology, but
			  CUPS does not like option names starting with
			  the prefix "Default")
			  Default: sRGB

	sRGB ............ IEC 61966-2.1 Default RGB colour space - sRGB
	AdobeRGB ........ Adobe RGB (1998)
	gimp-print ...... Use this setting if you are printing an sRGB
			  image from gimp (using the File->Print dialog).
			  Unfortunately, gimp mangles the image colors
			  during printing, and using this option setting
			  attempts to compensate for that.
	builtin ......... Does not install a CSA for DefaultRGB, but use
			  Ghostscript's builtin default (which is rather
			  unspecific, since it is not documented which
			  color space ghostscript assumes by default).

    Debug ............... Select the debug level.
			  Default: off

	off ............. Turn off debugging output.
	1 ............... Select debug level 1.
	2 ............... Select debug level 2.
	3 ............... Select debug level 3.


Ghostscript issues
------------------

    Please refer to README.ghostscript or to
    http://m2300w.sourceforge.net/gs/


Restrictions
------------

    * Currently only the high (1200x600) resolution is supported

    * Color profiles need to be revised for grayscale printing

    * There is no status monitor available, see (1)

    * Printing with the Duplex Unit is not supported, see (1)

    * Replacing consumables (toner) is not supported by the driver,
      but needs to be done under Windows, see (1)

    * In order to recover from an error condition (yellow error lamp
      on the printer) it is mostly necessary to cancel the print job
      and to turn the printer off, and then on again after a short
      pause, see (1).

      An exception is "out of paper", in this case you just need to
      refill the paper tray, and then the print job will continue.

    * DO NOT press the "Cancel" button on the printer, otherwise
      the printer will end up in an error condition (yellow lamp),
      see (1)

    * DO NOT submit print jobs while the printer is turned off or
      while the printer is still warming up, otherwise either your
      print job will be lost, or the printer may even end up in
      an error condition (yellow lamp), see (1)

      On the other hand, it is not a problem to submit a new print
      job when the printer has entered energy saving mode. The printer
      wakes up, when the new job arrives, see (1)

    Footnote (1):
    It is not likely that this restriction can be removed in the near
    future, since this would require bidirectional communication with
    the printer and decoding/reverse-engneering of the protocol spoken
    between the driver and the printer.


Debugging and reporting problems of the m2300w driver
-----------------------------------------------------

    Please report problems at http://sourceforge.net/projects/m2300w/

    For debugging purposes, m2300w-wrapper creates the following file
    in your /tmp directory:

	- /tmp/m2300w.log

    If a debug level >= 2 is selected, additionally the following
    files are created:

	- /tmp/m2300w_gsout.pbm
	- /tmp/m2300w.prn

    Please always attach /tmp/m2300w.log to your bug report.

    Please also save /tmp/m2300w_gsout.pbm and /tmp/m2300w.prn, since
    we might need them for the diagnosis of your problem. If we need
    these files, we'll let you know. But don't attach them a priori
    to the bug report, since these files are VERY LARGE.

    IMPORTANT SECURITY ADVISORY:

    /tmp/m2300w_gsout.pbm and /tmp/m2300w.prn contain the data
    of your last print job. Do not send them, if your print
    job did contain confident data.

    CUPS debugging:

    If there are problems in conjunction with CUPS, it can be
    useful to turn on CUPS debugging by setting "LogLevel debug"
    in /etc/cups/cupsd.conf. It is necessary to restart CUPS after
    modifying this file. The debugging output will appear in
    /var/log/cups/error_log.
